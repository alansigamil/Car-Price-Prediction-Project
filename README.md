# Car Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict car prices based on various features such as manufacturer, model, year of production, mileage, engine volume, and more. By analyzing and processing the data, we can develop a model that predicts car prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

## 1. 📊 **Understanding the Data**

- **Load and Inspect the Data**  
  Load the dataset and take an initial look at the data structure to understand its columns, types, and first few entries.

- **Check Data Types**  
  Review the data types of each column to ensure that numerical features are correctly recognized as numbers and categorical features are labeled as such.

- **Identify Missing Values**  
  Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on an appropriate strategy for handling them (e.g., imputation or removal).

- **Find Duplicates**  
  Detect any duplicate rows and assess whether they should be removed to maintain data integrity.

---

## 2. 🔢 **Basic Statistics**

- **Review Summary Stats**  
  Use `describe()` and `value_counts()` to get a statistical summary of the data, which includes key measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and counts.

- **Look for Zero Values and Constant Values**  
  Check for any columns with constant values or columns where all entries are zero, as these may not contribute to meaningful analysis.

---

## 3. 📈 **Variable Distribution**

- **Numerical Features**  
  Visualize the distribution of numerical features using **histograms** and **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)** plots. This will help in understanding the spread, skewness, and potential outliers.

- **Categorical Features**  
  Use **bar plots** to visualize the frequency distribution of categorical variables (e.g., car brands, categories). Check for class imbalances in these features.

---

## 4. 🔍 **Correlations**

- **Numerical Correlations**  
  Use the `corr()` method to calculate correlations between numerical features. This helps identify strong relationships between variables like engine volume and price.

- **Categorical Correlations**  
  Explore relationships between categorical features and the target variable (price) using visualizations like **stacked bar charts** or statistical tests.

---

## 5. 🔗 **Feature Interactions**

- **Use Scatter Plots**  
  Scatter plots are ideal for examining interactions between two numerical features. For example, you can plot **engine volume** vs **price** to visualize their relationship.

- **Box Plots for Categorical Features**  
  Use box plots to compare numerical features (e.g., **price**) across different categories (e.g., **car brands** or **fuel types**).

---

## 6. 🎯 **Target Variable Analysis**

- **Analyze the Target Variable’s Distribution**  
  Analyze the distribution of the target variable (**Price**) to check for skewness, outliers, and class imbalances. If the target variable has a long tail, consider log-transforming it.

- **Examine Relationships with Predictors**  
  Explore how the target variable relates to predictors (like **mileage**, **engine volume**, **year of production**) using **scatter plots** and **box plots**.

- **Class Imbalance**  
  If you're predicting a categorical price range, check for any class imbalances and decide whether resampling (over-sampling or under-sampling) is needed.

## 7. 🛠 **Technologies Used**

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
